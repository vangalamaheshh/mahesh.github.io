With 12+ years of hands on experience in academic, research and clinical settings working with genomic and clinical data, I bring broad spectrum of skills ranging from,

1) Data Engineering - full stack web development (Angular/Python Flask/Nginx); wide variety of database technologies from traditional SQL (SQLServer, MySQL, Postgres) to graph (Neo4j) to horizontally scalable (Cassandra) databases; building microservice architecture based scalable pipelines (Docker + Beam); event-driven realtime data processing (Kafka).

2) Data Science - machine learning (decision trees, random forest, XGBoost using Python Scikit Learn); deep learning (Python Keras and Tensorflow).

3) Dev/Ops - Kubernetes, Apache Spark + HDFS cluster deployment and management.

Creative and goal oriented, I take immense pride in end-to-end automation of operational tasks and a big believer of the quote "you don't know it until you teach it to a computer".

Looking forward to the opportunities to prove and enhance my leadership and technical expertise.
